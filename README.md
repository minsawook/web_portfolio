# Flutter Web Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio built with Flutter Web. It now includes an animated navigation drawer with quick links to each section and a cleaner theme using Google Fonts. The layout features subtle shadows and hover effects for a professional feel, and project cards animate into view as you scroll.

## Running

Run `flutter run -d chrome` to launch the web application.
